Overview
This repository contains C implementations of various search algorithms. These algorithms are designed to efficiently locate a target element within a collection of data. Understanding and implementing search algorithms is fundamental to computer science and programming.

Algorithms Included
Linear Search

File: linear_search.c
Description: Simple sequential search through an array to find the target element.
Binary Search

File: binary_search.c
Description: Efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays, dividing the search space in half with each iteration.
Hash Table Search

Files: hash_table.c, hash_table.h
Description: Implements a basic hash table for faster data retrieval using key-value pairs.
